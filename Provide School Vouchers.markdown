Providing school vouchers takes tax money away from public schools, making them less able to provide quality education to everyone. Vouchers do not make private education equally more accessible to all families, as understanding the system and having the time to navigate it is less possible for low income and less educated parents. Also, location and transportation are barriers to students in low income neighborhoods.
